PA1 Algorithm:


1. Output to the user a brief description of what the program does: "This program will calculate the square footage of a room and use that calculation to compute the price it would cost to purchase the necessary amount of carpet needed."

2. Input the length of the room "What is the length of the room?"

3. User will input number.

4. Input the width of the room "What is the width of the room?"

5. User will input number.

6. Multiply the length of the room by the width of the room to calculate the area.

7. Input the price of the carpet "How much does the carpet cost per square foot?"

8. User will input number.

9. Multiply that price by the area of the room.

6. Output will be the area of the room (in square feet) and the total price to purchase the carpet.
